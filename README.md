# EV_Market_Analysis
The project provides insights into EV market trends, growth rates, regional distributions, and key drivers using Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.
Market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that determines the potential sales volume within a given market. It helps businesses understand the magnitude of demand, assess market saturation levels, and identify growth opportunities.

Steps performed in the analysis of dataset:
1. The dataset was cleaned to remove any null values.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key insights, trends, and data characteristics in market data.
3. Performed exponential growth curve fitting to predict EV numbers for 2024 and the subsequent five years using historical data.
4. Created a time series plot to visualize current and projected electric vehicle (EV) market registrations over time

The areas of Electric Market that were analysed in this project are as follows:
  1. Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.
  2. City or county where EVs are most commonly registered .
  3. The most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.
  4. Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type.
  5. Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
  6. Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.

Insights:
  1. Buyers preferred BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) over PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle).
  2. The most popular and preferred manufacturer of EV is Tesla and the most registered model in Tesla is Model Y.
  3. While there are EVs available with high electric ranges, the average range is skewed lower due to a substantial number of vehicles with shorter ranges.
  4. The forecasted EV registrations predict an even more dramatic increase in the near future, with the number of registrations expected to rise sharply in the coming years.


Overall, the analysis of Electric Vehicle Market data point towards a promising future for the EV industry, indicating a significant shift in consumer preferences and a potential increase in related investment and business opportunities.
